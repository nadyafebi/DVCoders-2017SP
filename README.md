# dvcoders - 2017 Spring Projects

This repo contains projects that I made in the dvcoders club at Diablo Valley College during Spring 2017.

Each project folders has a readme explaining:
- **Goal**: The goal of the project as explained in the club meeting.
- **Improvement**: Improvement(s) that I made beyond the goal.

Original source code of the projects can be found [here](https://github.com/dvcoders/2017-spring-project).
